### Additional Notes

Section 3 and 5 is uncompleted because of time constraints. I am thankful for the opportunity given to complete this tech assessment and it is indeed interesting to think about the questions for this tech assessment. I believe that my willingness to learn and question the solution in the process can allow me to be an individual who strives to learn and improve in things I do. Thank you!
